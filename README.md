# Employee-Registration
This is just an demo project to show the how MVC architecture works.
This project is based on Servlet, Hibernate in backend with MySql database.
And in frontend i use basic html page with some bootstrap to make it look better. 
And the output of registration page is either success or error where i use Jsp(JAVA SERVER PAGE) with some css on success page only.
Basically this project is showcase of MVC Architecture with Java Full Stack Development.
